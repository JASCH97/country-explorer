# Country Explorer
Country Explorer is a responsive, single-page React application that allows users to explore countries from around the world using data from the REST Countries API. Users can view details about each country and search by name interactively.

## Features

### List of Countries

- Fetches all countries from `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`
- Displays each country as a card with:
  - Official Name
  - Flag
  - Region
  - Population

### Search Functionality

- Search by official country name via `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}`
- Dynamically filters the list as you type

### Country Detail View

Clicking on a country card reveals a detailed view (in a modal) with:
- Official and Common Name
- Flag
- Capital
- Region and Subregion
- Population
- Languages
- Currencies
- Border Countries (resolved by name)

### Responsive Design

- Optimized layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using Bootstrap and custom styles
- Ensures usability across various screen sizes

## Styling
This project uses React Bootstrap for UI layout and components, combined with custom CSS for styling adjustments:
   - Custom CSS using *.css files for component-level styling
   - React Bootstrap for layout and built-in components (Alert, Modal, Button)
   - Header with background image

Note: To ensure visual consistency and prevent style conflicts with Bootstrap's default styles, !important has been used in custom CSS rules. This was a temporary measure during initial integration with Bootstrap.

Why !important was used:
   - Override specificity of Bootstrap's predefined classes.
   - Ensure consistent styles across all components (e.g., button radius, input border, font colors).
   - Accelerate the UI development process during early stages.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive design.
- **REST Countries API**: API used to fetch country information.

## Project Structure

## Known Issues / Future Work
   - Refactor styles to minimize reliance on !important
   - Improve mobile responsiveness for modals
   - Add support for multi-field search (e.g., region or capital)
   - Add language support
